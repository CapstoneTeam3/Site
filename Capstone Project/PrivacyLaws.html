                    <p>An Act aims to give consumers more control over the personal information businesses collect. This law gives California residents the right to know how their information is used

                        a gross annual revenue of over $25 million; buy, receive, or sell personal information of 50,000 or more California residents, households, or devices; or derive more than 50% of

                    <p>The initiative represents an expansion of provisions first laid out by the California Consumer Privacy Act. In addition to the consumer protections, the proposition creates the
                        California Privacy Protection Agency. The agency will share consumer privacy oversight and enforcement duties with the California Department of Justice. Another effect of the
                        initiative is requiring businesses to obtain permission from consumers younger than 16 before collecting their data and permission from a parent or guardian before collecting data
                        from consumers younger than 13.</p>
